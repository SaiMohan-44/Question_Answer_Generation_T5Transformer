       "'From Trade to Territory                    The Company Establishes Power2 Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers. He  established control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India. After his death in 1707  many Mughal governors  subadars and big zamindars  began asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms. As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India  Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre. By the second half of the eighteenth century   however  a new power was emerging on the political horizon – the British. Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire In this chapter you will see how this came about.   1 – Bahadur Shah Zafar  and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson After Aurangzeb there was no  powerful Mughal ruler  but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important. In fact  when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857  Bahadur Shah Zafar  the Mughal emperor at the time  was seen as the natural leader. Once the revolt was put down by the company  Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom  and his sons were shot in  cold blood.     9    24925  10 OUR PASTS – IIIEast India Company  Comes East In 1600  the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England  Queen Elizabeth I  granting it the sole right to trade with the East. This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company. With this charter  the Company could venture across the oceans  looking for new lands from which it could buy goods  at a cheap price  and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices. The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies. Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition  so that they could buy cheap and sell dear. The royal charter  however  could not prevent other  European powers from entering the Eastern markets. By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa  round the Cape of Good Hope  and crossed the Indian Ocean  the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India  and had their base in Goa. In fact  it was Vasco da Gama  a Portuguese explorer  who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498. By the early seventeenth century  the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean. Soon the French traders arrived on the scene.  The problem was that all the companies were  interested in buying the same things. The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe. Pepper  cloves  cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand. Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased  and this reduced the profits that could be earned. The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors. The urge to secure markets  therefore  led to fierce battles between the trading companies. Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other’s ships  blockaded routes  and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of    2 –  Routes to India in the eighteenth century Mercantile – A business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade  buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices    10    24926  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         11goods. Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts  were protected through fortification.  This effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable  trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers. The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics. Let us see how this happened.  East India Company begins trade in Bengal The first English factory was set up on the banks of                  the river Hugli in 1651. This was the base from which the Company’s traders  known at that time as “factors”  operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored  and it had offices where Company officials sat. As trade expanded  the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory. By 1696  it began building a fort around the settlement. Two years later  it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata  which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today. It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting  the Company the right to trade duty free. The Company tried continuously to press for  more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. Aurangzeb’s farman  for instance  had granted only the  Company the right to trade duty free. But officials of  the Company  who were carrying on private trade on the side  were expected to pay duty. This they refused to pay  causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal. How could the Nawab of Bengal  Murshid Quli Khan    not protest   3 – Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras  painted by William Simpson  1867Farman – A royal edict  a royal order    11    24927  12 OUR PASTS – IIIHow trade led to battles Through the early eighteenth century  the conflict between  the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified.  After the death of Aurangzeb  the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy  as other regional powers were doing at that time. Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal. Each one of them was a strong ruler. They refused to grant the Company concessions  demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade  denied it any right to mint coins  and stopped it from extending its fortifications. Accusing the Company of deceit  they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab. It was refusing to pay taxes  writing disrespectful letters  and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials.  The Company on its part declared that the unjust  demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company  and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade  it had to enlarge its settlements  buy up villages  and rebuild its forts.     The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated  in the famous Battle of Plassey. The Battle of Plassey  When Alivardi Khan died in 1756  Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal. The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would  willingly  give trade concessions and other privileges. So it tried  though without success  to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion  stop fortification  and pay the revenues. After negotiations failed  the Nawab marched with 30 000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar  captured the Company officials  locked the warehouse  disarmed all Englishmen  and blockaded English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there.  On hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta   Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive  reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. Finally   in 1757  Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey. One of the main reasons for   Did you know Did you know how Plassey  got its name Plassey is an anglicised pronunciation  of Palashi and the place derived its name from the palash  tree known for its  beautiful red flowers that yield gulal   the powder  used in the festival of Holi.  4 – Robert Clive  Puppet – Literally  a toy  that you can move with strings. The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else.    12    24928  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         13 the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar  one  of Sirajuddaulah’s commanders  never fought the battle. Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah.  The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major  victory the Company won in India.   5 – The General Court Room  East India House  Leadenhall Street The Court of  Proprietors of the East India Company had their meetings in the East India House on Leadenhall Street in London. This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress. The promise of riches The territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England. After the Battle of Plassey  Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt  one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch  on 7  January 1759 from Calcutta  But so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company … I flatter myself … that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms ... Now I leave you to judge  whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces … be an object deserving the public attention ...Source 1   6 –  Sirajuddaulah    13    24930  14 OUR PASTS – III After the defeat at Plassey  Sirajuddaulah was  assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab. The Company  was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration. Its prime objective was the expansion of trade. If this could be done without conquest  through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges  then territories need not be taken over directly.  Soon the Company discovered that this was rather  difficult. For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be. After all  they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects.  What could the Company do When Mir Jafar  protested  the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place. When Mir Qasim complained  he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar 1764  driven out of Bengal  and Mir Jafar was reinstalled. The Nawab had to pay Rs. 500 000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars  and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses. It wanted more territories and more revenue. By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765  the mood of the Company had changed. Having failed to work with puppet nawabs  Clive declared “We must indeed become   nawabs ourselves”. Finally  in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the  Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced. From the early eighteenth century  its trade with India had expanded. But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India. The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey  and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India  maintain Company troops  and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.   Company officials become “nabobs” What did it mean to be nawabs It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority. But it also meant something else. Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs.Source 2 The Nawab  complains In 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders When they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon  which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort  surrounded it  with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls. They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs. 100 000… they rob and plunder and carry great number of the king’s subjects of both sexes into slavery into their own country …     14    24930  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         15After the Battle of Plassey  the actual nawabs of  Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of  money as personal gifts to Company officials. Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India. He had come to Madras now Chennai from England in 1743 at the age of 18. When in 1767 he left India  his Indian fortune was worth £401 102. Interestingly  when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764  he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself crossexamined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth. Although he was acquitted  he committed suicide   in 1774.  However  not all Company officials succeeded in  making money like Clive. Many died an early death in India due to disease and war  and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest. Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India  return to Britain and lead a comfortable life. Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches. They were called   “nabobs” – an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab. They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons.  Company Rule Expands If we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857  certain key aspects emerge. The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory. Instead it used a variety of political  economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom.  After the Battle of Buxar 1764  the Company  appointed Residents in Indian states. They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company. Through the Residents  the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states. They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne  and who was to be appointed in administrative posts. Sometimes  the Company forced the states into a “subsidiary alliance”. According to the terms of this alliance  Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company  but  How did Clive  see himself At his hearing in front  of a Committee in Parliament  Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey. This is what he said Consider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me A great prince was dependent on my pleasure an opulent city lay at my mercy its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone  piled on either hand with gold and jewels Mr Chairman  at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation.Source 3 Imagine that you are a young Company official  who has been in India for a few months.

Activity    15    24930  16 OUR PASTS – III Source 4   7 – Nawab Shujauddaulah   of Awadh  with his sons and the British Resident  painted by Tilly Kettle oil  1772 The treaties that followed the  Battle of Buxar forced Nawab Shujauddaulah to give up much of his authority. Here  however  he poses in regal splendour  towering over the Resident. Injunction – Instruction Subservience –  Submissivenesshad to pay for the “subsidiary forces” that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment  then part of their territory was taken away as penalty. For example  when Richard Wellesley was GovernorGeneral 1798–1805  the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801  as he failed to pay for the “subsidiary forces”. Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds. What power did the Resident have This is what James Mill  the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland  wrote about the residents appointed by the Company.  We place a resident  who really is king of the country  whatever injunctions of noninterference he may act under. As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience  and does what is agreeable  to the residents  that is  to the British Government  things go on quietly they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs … but when anything of a different nature happens  the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong  then comes clashing and disturbance. James Mill 1832 Tipu Sultan – The “Tiger of Mysore” The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests. This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore. Mysore had grown in strength under the leadership  of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali ruled from 1761 to 1782 and his famous son Tipu Sultan ruled from 1782 to 1799. Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785  Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood  pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom  and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also established a close    8  – Tipu Sultan    16    24932  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         17relationship with the French in India  and modernised  his army with their help.  The British were furious. They saw Haidar and Tipu  as ambitious  arrogant and dangerous – rulers who had to be controlled and crushed. Four wars were fought with Mysore 1767–69  1780–84  1790–92 and 1799. Only in the last – the Battle of Seringapatam – did the Company ultimately win a victory. Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam  Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state.    10 – Tipu’s toy tiger  This is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed.   You can see a tiger mauling a European soldier. When its handle was turned  the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked. This  toytiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799.  9 – Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages  painted by Daniel Orme  1793 The Company forces were  defeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles. But in 1792  attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas  the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company  Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were  taken away as hostages. British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of  British power. The legend of Tipu Kings are often surrounded  by legend and their powers glorified through folklore. Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782. It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend. There he came face to face with a tiger. His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground. He battled with the tiger unarmed until he  managed to reach down and pick up the dagger. Finally  he was able to kill the tiger in the battle. After this  he came to be known as the “Tiger of Mysore”. He had the image of the tiger on his flag.     17    24934  18 OUR PASTS – IIIWar with the Marathas  From the late eighteenth century  the Company also  sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power. With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761  the Marathas’ dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered. They were divided into many states under different chiefs sardars belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia  Holkar  Gaikwad and Bhonsle. These chiefs were held together in a confederacy  under a Peshwa Principal Minister  who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune. Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century.  The Marathas were subdued in a series of wars.  In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai  there was no clear victor. The Second AngloMaratha War 1803–05 was fought on different fronts  resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi. Finally  the Third AngloMaratha War of 1817–19 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas.  The claim to paramountcy It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century  the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion. Under Lord Hastings GovernorGeneral from 1813 to 1823  a new policy of “paramountcy” was initiated. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme  hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests  it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom. This view continued to guide later British policies as well.  This process  however  did not go unchallenged. For  example  when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor in Karnataka today  Rani Channamma took to arms and led an antiBritish resistance movement. She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829. But Rayanna  a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor   carried on the resistance. With popular support  he destroyed many British camps and records. He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830. You will read more about several cases of resistance later in   the book.  11 – Lord Hastings.    Confederacy – AllianceActivity Imagine that you have   come across two old  newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan. One is a British paper and the other is from Mysore. Write the headline for each of  the two newspapers.   12 – A Statue of the  Queen of  Kitoor Karnataka     18    24936  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         19 In the late 1830s  the East India  Company became worried about Russia.  It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the northwest. Driven by this fear  the British now wanted to secure their control over the northwest. They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842  and established indirect Company rule there. Sind was taken over in 1843. Next in line was Punjab. But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company. After his death in 1839  two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh  kingdom. Ultimately  in 1849  Punjab   was annexed. The Doctrine of Lapse The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the GovernorGeneral from 1848 to 1856. He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse. The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would “lapse”  that is  become a part of Company territory. One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine Satara 1848  Sambalpur 1850  Udaipur 1852  Nagpur 1853 and   Jhansi 1854.  Finally  in 1856  the Company also took over Awadh.  This time the British had an added argument – they said they were “obliged by duty” to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the “misgovernment” of the Nawab Enraged by the humiliating way in which  the Nawab was deposed  the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857.    13  – Maharaja Ranjit Singh holding court     14   – A portrait of  Veer  Surendra Sai Activity Imagine that you are a nawab’s nephew and have been  brought up thinking that you will one day be king.

In each of these maps  try and identify the different parts of India that were not under British rule.   14 a – India  1797   14 b – India  1840   14 c – India  1857    20    24940  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         21Setting up a New Administration Warren Hastings GovernorGeneral from 1773 to 1785  was one of the many important figures who played a significant role in the expansion of Company power. By his time the Company had acquired power not only                 in Bengal  but also in Bombay and Madras. British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies  Bengal  Madras and Bombay. Each was ruled by a Governor. The supreme head of the administration was the GovernorGeneral. Warren Hastings  the first GovernorGeneral  introduced several administrative reforms  notably in the sphere of justice.  From 1772 a new system of justice was established.  Each district was to have two courts – a criminal court faujdari adalat  and a civil court  diwani adalat . Maulvis  and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti  but under the supervision of the collectors. Qazi – A judge Mufti – A jurist of the  Muslim community responsible for expounding the law           that the qazi would administer Impeachment – A trial  by the House of Lords           in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons   15 – The trial of Warren Hastings  painted by R.G. Pollard  1789 When Warren Hastings went back to England in 1785  Edmund Burke accused him  of being personally responsible for the misgovernment of Bengal. This led to an impeachment proceeding in the British Parliament that lasted seven years.     21    24942  22 OUR PASTS – III A major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave  different interpretations of local laws based on different  schools of the dharmashastra . To bring about uniformity   in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778  a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges. Under the Regulating Act of 1773  a new Supreme Court was established  while a court of appeal – the Sadar Nizamat Adalat – was also set up at Calcutta. The principal figure in an Indian district was the  Collector. As the title suggests  his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges  police officers and darogas .  His office – the Collectorate – became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority. The Company army Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength. The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry sawars trained soldiers on horseback and infantry  that is  paidal foot soldiers. They were given  training in archery  teerandazi  and the use of the sword.  The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry. The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers. A change occurred in the eighteenth century when  Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers. The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army  which came to be known as the sepoy army from the Indian word sipahi  meaning soldier.  As warfare technology changed from the 1820s  the  cavalry requirements of the Company’s army declined. This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma  Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks. The soldiers of  the Company’s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important.  In the early nineteenth century  the British began   to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were Here is a passage from Edmund Burke’s eloquent opening speech during the impeachment of Warren Hastings I impeach him in the name of the people of India  whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly in the name of human nature itself  in the name of both the sexes  in the name of every age  in the name of every rank  I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all.Source 5 “I impeach the  common enemy and  oppressor of all.” Dharmashastras – Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour  composed from c. 500  BCE onwards Sawar – Men on horses Musket – A heavy gun  used by infantry soldiers Matchlock – An early  type of gun in which the powder was ignited by a match    22    24942  FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY         23increasingly subjected to Europeanstyle training  drill  and discipline that regulated their life far more than before. Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers. Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities  What did the sepoys feel How did they react to the  changes in their lives and their identity – that is  their sense of who they were The Revolt of 1857 gives us a glimpse into the world of the sepoys. You will read about this revolt in Chapter 5. Conclusion Thus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power. The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process. Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea. Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a faroff country like India.  By 1857  the Company came to exercise direct rule  over about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent. Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country  the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control.   16 – A sawar of Bengal in the  service of the Company  painted by an unknown Indian artist  1780 After the battles with the  Marathas and the Mysore rulers  the Company realised the importance of strengthening its cavalry force.     23    24943  24 OUR PASTS – III Let’s recall 1.

    "activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and\n",
    "starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis,\n",
    "from the Greek phōs, \"light\", and synthesis , \"putting together\". Most plants, algae, and\n",

    "is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere,\n",

    "Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins\n",
    "when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll\n",
    "(and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles\n",
    "called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in\n",
    "the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons\n",
    "from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting\n",
    "of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy,\n",
    "enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine\n",
    "dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n",
    "In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of\n",
    "light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide\n",
    "is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate\n",
    "(RuBP).[5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting\n",
    "compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other\n",

    "the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the\n",
    "average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts, which is\n",
    "about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms\n",
    "also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billion metric tons), of carbon\n",
    "into biomass per year. That plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air, soil, and water\n",
